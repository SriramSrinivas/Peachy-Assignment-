Peachy-Assignment-
==================

This repository hosts the materials for a hands-on assignment focused on distributed Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and performance optimization on multi-GPU systems. It provides students with the necessary resources to explore advanced concepts in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence.

Assignment Description
----------------------

The full details of the assignment, including objectives, tasks, and deliverables, can be found in:

-   **`assignment3.md`**: [Link to assignment3.md](https://github.com/SriramSrinivas/Peachy-Assignment-/blob/main/assignmnet3.md "null")

Getting Started: Base Code
--------------------------

To help you begin, a scaffolded base code is provided, offering a foundational implementation for the GCN model, graph partitioning, and distributed training setup.

-   **`Peachybasecode`**: [Link to Peachybasecode](https://github.com/SriramSrinivas/Peachy-Assignment-/blob/main/Peachybasecode.ipynb "null")

This base code is designed to be extended and modified as per the assignment requirements, allowing you to focus on the core challenges of distributed GCN training and performance analysis.
